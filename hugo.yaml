    Title: Hi!
    Content: "I'm Lief, currently a medical student at [UQ](https://www.uq.edu.au/). I have an interest (and a bachelor's degree) in pure maths and physics, and I like to code in my spare time. I also co-host a D&D podcast, [Level Down!](https://linktr.ee/leveldown). I like reading, hiking and photography.
